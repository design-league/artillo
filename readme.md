# Artillo
## October 2014 â€“ September 2015
Artillo is a pillow-shaped device to make digital art more accessible for those with reduced motor function, such as those caused by C.P. For this specific audience, it was well known that the device had to adhere to certain aspects of convenience, simple use, overall comfort, appealing appearance, and safety from hazards.

Artillo allows the user to choose and adjust the settings in a digital art program through bodily movements. We accomplished this by first creating a comfortable pillow base, and rigging it with Arduino hardware and basic pressure sensors. In the end we were able to create a device that had achieved a purpose, assisting artists in creating their art.

We came up the concept of this project through several interviews with the art department at UCP (United Cerebral Palsy). We worked with the Natalie who is the art instructor and one of her students, Tawn in which we found that one of the main problems the students were facing was the ability to actually use their tablets to draw with the drawing applications they were using.

Through these interviews we decided to develop a project that addressed issues with adjusting settings, such as brush width, color, etc., within digital art programs. For the sake of this specific project we created our own art program from scratch using Processing, an open source programming language. With this we were able to make a perfect match for our hardware.

BONUS: Former President Barack Obama invited us to the White House Conference at Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Two people from our team went to represent us and demonstrate how our project works. The then President gave a speech about how technology bridges the gap between those who have access to many services and those who do not.
